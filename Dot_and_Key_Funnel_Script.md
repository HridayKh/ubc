# Dot & Key Funnel Strategy: Team Discussion Script
**Duration: 4 minutes | 5 Speakers**

**VEDANT** (Marketing Lead): Good morning everyone! So we've been analyzing Dot & Key's marketing funnel, and honestly, the numbers are pretty concerning. They've got this massive 58% cart abandonment rate—that's way higher than the industry standard of 45%.

**VAIDIK** (Data Analyst): But wait, Vedant—here's where it gets interesting. Despite that challenge, their Middle-of-Funnel strategy is actually crushing it! They're seeing 35% email engagement when most brands struggle to hit 22%. Plus, their micro-influencer game is strong—957,000 views from just 213 creators.

**VRINDA** (Customer Experience): That makes total sense when you look at who they're targeting. These are Gen Z women in smaller cities—Tier 2 and 3—who really care about clean beauty and knowing what's in their products. And get this—70% of their revenue actually comes from these smaller cities, not the metros!

**HRIDHAY** (Technology): Oh, and can we talk about their tech setup? It's actually pretty smart. They're using WhatsApp for cart recovery—you know, those gentle reminder messages that don't feel pushy? Plus they've got these AI chatbots that actually help people figure out which products to use.

**VEDANT**: Right! So their awareness stage is solid—Instagram Reels, those viral #BreakUpWithAcne campaigns. But the real magic happens in the middle part of their funnel, where they're educating customers instead of just trying to sell to them.

**VAIDIK**: Exactly! They do these webinars with actual dermatologists, send helpful emails based on what you've been looking at... it's like having a skincare friend who knows what they're talking about.

**VRINDA**: And when it comes to actually converting people, they're not being manipulative about it. They use real customer photos—no fake transformations—and make it super easy to reorder products you love. Oh, and those ₹99 trial kits? Genius move for getting people to try without the big commitment.

**HRIDHAY**: Oh, and here's something cool—they suggest products that actually go together. Like, "Hey, since you're buying this vitamin C serum, you might want this moisturizer too." It's boosting their average order value from ₹850 to almost ₹1,200.

**VEDANT**: Now, here's an ambitious goal—they want to cut their customer acquisition cost from ₹420 to ₹320. That's a 25% reduction! But honestly? Looking at their Amazon partnership results, I think they can do it.

**VAIDIK**: Oh absolutely! Their Amazon miniTV collaboration was insane—84 million people saw their content, and 95% actually watched the whole thing. Search volume for their products jumped by 65%!

**VRINDA**: What I really love is how they're building real relationships with customers. They have these Discord communities where people actually help each other with skincare advice. It's not just about selling—they're creating this whole support system.

**HRIDHAY**: And they're getting really smart with data—predicting when someone might stop buying and reaching out before it happens.

**VEDANT**: Here's something interesting—they don't just do the same campaigns all year. During Diwali, they'll do festive packages. When it's summer, they push sunscreen harder. They actually pay attention to what people need when they need it.

**VAIDIK**: Smart! And speaking of smart moves, their festival campaigns aren't just about sales—they're celebrating Indian culture, which really resonates with their audience.

**VRINDA**: They had a bit of a rough patch with that Hania Aamir controversy—their trust scores dropped to 2.5 out of 5. But you know what? Sometimes crisis creates opportunity. Now they're doubling down on their "Made in India" story.

**GURANSH** (Operations): And they're handling customer service through WhatsApp now. People can literally ask skincare questions and get real advice, not just sales pitches.

**VEDANT**: So here's the big question—they're projecting ₹350 crores in revenue for this year. With their current growth rate of 244%, I honestly think they're being modest. They might actually beat that target.

**VAIDIK**: I agree! When you improve email engagement from 22% to 35%, and your conversion rates go up by 15%... the math just works out really well.

**VRINDA**: Plus, they've got 6 million customers now, and these people are becoming real fans. They're not just buying once—they're sharing their experiences on social media, bringing in their friends...

**HRIDHAY**: The future stuff is exciting too. Imagine being able to virtually try on skincare products or getting product recommendations through voice commands—they're working on all of that.

**VEDANT**: So their strategy is pretty balanced—70% of what they're doing is stuff that's already working, and 30% is new experiments. It's smart because you don't want to mess with success, but you also can't get stagnant.

**VAIDIK**: Their influencer partnerships are gold, and those Amazon collaborations are paying off big time.

**VRINDA**: What I love most is that they really understand their customers. These young women in smaller cities want quality products they can trust, and they want to learn about skincare, not just buy stuff blindly.

**GURANSH**: And all their tech platforms talk to each other seamlessly. Customer data, email systems, loyalty programs—it all works together.

**VEDANT**: So bottom line—what's their biggest opportunity? I think it's becoming the go-to skincare education brand for young Indian women while keeping products affordable.

**VAIDIK**: For me, it's fixing that cart abandonment issue. Getting it from 58% down to 40% would be huge for revenue.

**VRINDA**: Building back that trust after the controversy. Indian consumers really value authenticity, and if they can nail that "Made in India" story, they'll win big.

**HRIDHAY**: The AI personalization is going to be a game-changer. Imagine getting skincare advice that's tailored exactly to your skin type and concerns.

**VEDANT**: Perfect! So everyone, Dot & Key's funnel strategy is really about combining what works—social media, influencers, great products—with smart technology and genuine customer care. They're positioned to hit that ₹350 crore target and become leaders in India's massive ₹28 billion beauty market.

**ALL**: Thank you!
