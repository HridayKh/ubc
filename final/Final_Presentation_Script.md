**Total Duration: 5 minutes | Team Members: Vedant, Vrinda, Vaidik, Hriday, Guransh**

## **SLIDE 1: INTRODUCTION (30 seconds) - VEDANT**

"Good morning everyone! I'm Vedant, and with me are Vrinda, Vaidik, Hriday, and Guransh. Today we're presenting our Instagram marketing strategy for Dot & Key - a brand that turned a major crisis into their biggest competitive advantage. Founded by Anisha Saraf in 2018, Dot & Key has redefined what science-backed skincare means for young India."

---

## **SLIDE 2: BRAND IDENTITY & PERFORMANCE (45 seconds) - VRINDA**

"Dot & Key's mission is to democratize high-efficacy, science-powered skincare with a playful brand voice. Their positioning? 'Sexy Science' - delivering credible results with modern energy. 

The numbers speak volumes: FY24 revenue jumped from ₹57.7 crores to ₹198.3 crores - that's 244% growth! They've built a customer base of 6+ million with an Instagram engagement rate of 4.5%, which absolutely crushes the industry standard. 

However, there's a critical trust gap - their Trustpilot rating sits at just 2.2 out of 5 with only 9 reviews. This credibility challenge is what we'll address in our strategy."

---

## **SLIDE 3: BRAND DIFFERENTIATION (30 seconds) - VAIDIK**

"Dot & Key's unique selling proposition combines science-backed formulations with quirky, Indian-fit branding. Their key differentiator is agile new product development and bold influencer betting.

Current gaps include trust issues on review platforms, limited global leverage, and being newer to quick commerce. But these gaps are exactly where our strategy creates opportunities to dominate the market through strategic positioning against competitors."

---

## **SLIDE 4: CUSTOMER PERSONAS (30 seconds) - HRIDAY**

"We've identified three core personas:

First, the Informed Millennial - our primary target. They're product-aware, influenced by creators and Instagram Reels, rely on peer reviews, and demand rapid delivery.

Second, Experimental Gen Z - our growth opportunity. They're early adopters looking for the next big thing.

Third, Aspiring Beauty Enthusiasts in emerging markets - they're just entering the premium skincare space and represent massive potential."

---

## **SLIDE 5: PROBLEMS VS OPPORTUNITIES - SWOT (45 seconds) - GURANSH**

"Our SWOT analysis reveals fascinating insights:

Strengths: Viral influencer strategy, quick commerce partnerships, and engaging viral content that drives real engagement.

Weaknesses: 58% cart abandonment rate versus industry average of 45%, and patchy review management on Trustpilot.

Opportunities: Customer retention through BIK and Reelo integration, expansion to Gen Z social platforms, and targeting the global NRI audience.

Threats: Shrinking attention spans, rising ad costs increasing CAC, and algorithmic unpredictability.

The summary? We win with viral content and influencer collaborations, but high cart abandonment and review engagement remain our biggest challenges to solve."

## **SLIDE 6: THE HANIA AAMIR CRISIS & TRUST RECOVERY (30 seconds) - VEDANT**

"In April 2025, an influencer collaboration during a national crisis led to #BoycottDotAndKey trending, damaging nationalist consumer trust.

But here's what's brilliant - instead of defensive damage control, they launched a Trust Recovery Framework: 'Made in India, Made for India' campaign with donations to Armed Forces welfare and festival-focused local influencer partnerships. They turned a crisis into a competitive advantage by strengthening their nation-first sentiment."

---

## **SLIDE 7: CURRENT CONTENT STRATEGY AUDIT (30 seconds) - VRINDA**

"Current content mix: 60% Reels, 30% photos and carousels, 10% stories with posting frequency of twice weekly plus daily stories.

Their #BreakUpWithAcne campaign leveraged 213 influencers, generated 957K views and 8K+ comments. Their 4.5% engagement rate significantly outperforms industry standards due to strong visuals, influencer-led content, and confident messaging."

---

## **SLIDE 8: PROPOSED CONTENT STRATEGY (45 seconds) - VAIDIK**

"Our recommended content mix: 50% Reels, 20% Stories, 20% Carousels, 10% Lives.

Five content pillars: Evidence-based educational videos, Real customer stories, Behind-the-scenes culture content, Meme-trends for relatability, and Community engagement through Q&A and polls.

Key innovations include grid reordering for story arcs, 2x speed tips and hacks for busy millennials, and a dedicated BTS Instagram page showcasing company culture. This strategy addresses the trust gap while maintaining viral potential."

---

## **SLIDE 9: META ADS ANALYSIS (30 seconds) - HRIDAY**

"We analyzed their top 3 Meta ads using Facebook Ads Library:

Awareness stage uses Reel ads for product discovery with quirky routines and pop music. Consideration stage offers two approaches - photo ads focusing on product features, and alternative photo ads directing to Flipkart for users who don't trust the brand store yet.

This dual approach acknowledges their trust gap while maximizing conversion opportunities."

---

## **SLIDE 10: OUR META AD CREATION (30 seconds) - GURANSH**

"Our original ad objective: Drive first-time trial of Vitamin C Serum.

Target audience: Women and men aged 18-32 in metros and tier-1 cities with skincare and beauty interests.

Optimization tactics include audience exclusions to reduce wasted spend - excluding RTOs, ticket raisers, and filtering regular buyers. This precision targeting directly addresses their ₹420 CAC challenge with a goal of reaching ₹320."

---

## **SLIDE 11: PLATFORM DIVERSIFICATION (30 seconds) - VEDANT**

"Beyond Instagram, we're strategically expanding:

Reddit beauty communities grew 42% with 18% increase in beauty topic views. Discord communities are organically forming with 95% having fewer than 100 people - perfect for micro-community building. BeReal shows 22% higher response rate than Snapchat with 40 million MAUs, 85% being Gen Z. Spotify beauty podcast listens increased 130%.

This diversification directly targets our Gen Z experimental persona while reducing dependency on algorithm changes."

---

## **SLIDE 12: GROWTH & RETENTION - CAC AND AOV OPTIMIZATION (45 seconds) - VRINDA**

"Critical gaps to address: Cart abandonment at 58% versus industry 45%, AOV at ₹850 targeting ₹1,200, and CAC at ₹420 targeting ₹320.

Our optimization tactics: 'Complete your routine' upsell at checkout, free shipping threshold at ₹999+, AI-powered upsell recommendations, sample sachets for ₹1,500+ orders, and trial packs through Smytten App.

Profit-on-first-purchase strategy includes starter kits, subscription discounts, and referral offers that immediately improve unit economics."

---

## **SLIDE 13: LOYALTY, REFERRAL & RETENTION PROGRAMS (45 seconds) - VAIDIK**

"Our comprehensive retention strategy:

Points Program: 1 point equals ₹1, 100 points equals ₹10 reward. Referral system: Give ₹300, Get ₹300 with 50-point social bonuses. Reactivation through segmented WhatsApp and email offers plus micro-community perks via Discord.

Technology stack: BIK for WhatsApp automation, REELO for loyalty management, Hotjar for heatmaps, Manychat for Instagram automation. Plus Instagram DM campaigns with visual reminders using user-generated content."

---

## **SLIDE 14: MEASURABLE GOALS & KPIS (30 seconds) - HRIDAY**

"Our targets: Engagement rate above 6%, cart abandonment below 40%, higher first-order profit through strategic kits, and +1 star Trustpilot improvement.

Strategies include doubling down on peer-led UGC, CEO presence in review replies, incentivized Trustpilot reviews, automated WhatsApp and email cart recovery flows, and margin-friendly starter bundles.

Timeline: 6 months to achieve these metrics with monthly tracking and optimization."

---

## **SLIDE 15: CONCLUSION & VISION (30 seconds) - GURANSH**

"Our strategy transforms Dot & Key from a skincare brand into India's premier beauty education platform. By combining nation-first sentiment, social innovation, and user-first technology, we're positioning them as the benchmark for new-age Indian D2C beauty.

The result? A clear path from ₹198 crores to ₹350 crores through systematic conversion optimization, trust building, and community-driven growth.

Dot & Key isn't just selling skincare - they're building India's most trusted beauty community, one customer at a time."
