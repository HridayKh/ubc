**Duration: 5 minutes | Conversational Business Presentation**

## **OPENING: WELCOME & AGENDA**

**VEDANT**: Good morning everyone! I'm Vedant, and these are my amazing teammates—Vaidik, Vrinda, Hridhay, and Guransh. We're really excited to share something interesting with you today about Dot & Key. You know, it's fascinating how a beauty brand can go from facing a massive boycott to actually turning that crisis into their biggest strength. We'll show you exactly how they did it and our plan to take them from ₹198 crores to ₹350 crores.

**VAIDIK**: Absolutely! And honestly, when we first looked at their numbers, we were like "Wait, this doesn't make sense!" They're absolutely killing it on Instagram, their campaigns are viral, but then... their customers just abandon carts like crazy. So in the next few minutes, we'll break down what's really happening and how we can fix it. Ready? Let's jump in!

## **SLIDE 1: THE OPPORTUNITY**

**VEDANT**: So here's what blew our minds—Dot & Key has ₹198 crores in revenue, they're growing at 244%, they've got 6 million customers, and their Instagram engagement? 5.6%! That's insane compared to most brands struggling at 3%. But here's the kicker—58% of people put stuff in their cart and then just... leave. Compare that to the industry average of 45%, and you realize they're bleeding money.

**VAIDIK**: Right? Like, we dove deeper and found their #BreakUpWithAcne campaign got 957K views with 213 influencers. Sounds great, until you see their Trustpilot rating is 2.2 out of 5. Ouch! Plus, they're spending ₹420 to get each customer when they should be spending ₹320. So they're amazing at getting attention, but something's going wrong when it comes to actually converting people.

**VRINDA**: And you know what's really interesting about their customers? These are smart, tech-savvy women mostly in big cities. They'll literally spend 20 minutes researching a ₹400 face serum, reading reviews, watching YouTube videos, the whole nine yards. But then they want to check out in under a minute! It's like they want to research forever but buy instantly. That mismatch is exactly where they're losing people.

**HRIDHAY**: So we started thinking—this isn't just Dot & Key's problem. The entire Indian beauty market is worth ₹28 billion, and cart abandonment is costing everyone around ₹7,000 crores every year! If we can crack this code for Dot & Key, we're basically creating a playbook that could transform how beauty brands work in India.

**GURANSH**: Exactly! And here's the thing—while the big international players like L'Oréal are stuck with slow, traditional processes, Indian brands like Dot & Key can move super fast. They just need to figure out how to turn that speed into trust. That's where our strategy comes in, and honestly, we think we can get them to ₹350 crores by fixing these conversion issues.

## **SLIDE 2: CRISIS TO COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE**

**HRIDHAY**: Okay, so remember April? The whole Hania Aamir controversy happened and suddenly #BoycottDotAndKey was trending everywhere. Most brands would've panicked, right? But what Dot & Key did was actually genius. Instead of going defensive and apologizing, they went completely the opposite direction and turned it into a patriotic moment.

**GURANSH**: Yes! I was so impressed by how fast they moved. Like, literally within days, they launched this whole "Made in India, Made for India" campaign. They partnered with the Armed Forces, started donating ₹1 from every purchase to welfare programs. It wasn't just damage control—they basically said "You want to boycott us? Fine, but look how Indian we actually are!" The speed of this turnaround shows they really know how to pivot under pressure.

**VRINDA**: What I found really smart about this is how well they understood their audience psychology. You know, especially in smaller cities where they make 70% of their revenue, people really care about supporting Indian brands and national pride. So by flipping the script from "foreign controversy" to "proudly Indian," they actually ended up connecting even more deeply with their core customers. The crisis basically fast-tracked their positioning as an authentic Indian brand, which is exactly what their customers wanted anyway.

## **SLIDE 3: THE MOF SOLUTION**

**VEDANT**: Alright, so here's our solution, and we're calling it Middle-of-Funnel optimization—basically focusing on that crucial space between "I'm interested" and "I'm buying." Think of it like this: they're already great at the top part—getting people's attention through Instagram and influencers. And they're okay at the bottom part—the actual checkout. But that middle part? Where people are like "Hmm, should I trust this brand?" That's where we need to work our magic.

**HRIDHAY**: The tech side is where it gets really exciting! So we're bringing in these tools—BIK for smart WhatsApp automation and REELO for loyalty programs. But here's the cool part: instead of just sending random "You forgot your cart!" messages, the system actually learns how each person behaves. Some people need immediate reminders, others need to think about it for 2 hours, some need a whole day. The system figures out what works for each customer and personalizes everything. It's like having a personal shopping assistant for every single customer.

**VAIDIK**: And the budget allocation makes total sense when you see the numbers. We're putting 40% into getting people's attention—that's working with over 4,000 micro-influencers to reach 10 million people monthly. Then 25% goes into educating people with content that's actually getting 5% email click rates when most brands get 3.2%. The remaining budget goes into converting people and keeping them engaged. Plus, we're partnering with Blinkit and Zepto so people can get their skincare delivered in 2 hours. Instant gratification meets impulse buying!

**GURANSH**: What I love about our operational approach is the ₹99 trial kits. Remember how Vrinda said customers research for 20 minutes? Well, now they can actually try the product without committing to the full-size version. We're also doing this "Complete your routine" bundling thing that takes the average order from ₹850 to ₹1,200 by helping people build proper skincare routines. And our referral program—"Give ₹300, Get ₹300"—is bringing down customer acquisition costs from ₹420 to our target of ₹320 while building community at the same time.

## **SLIDE 4: INNOVATION STRATEGY**

**VRINDA**: So our approach is like 70% "tried and tested" and 30% "let's try something cool." The tried and tested part? Their Amazon miniTV content is absolutely crushing it—84 million people watched, 95% finished the videos, and searches for their products went up 65%. Indians really want to learn about beauty, not just buy products. People are buying into the education and the community feeling, not just the face cream.

**HRIDHAY**: Now for the fun, innovative stuff! We're setting up Discord communities where Gen Z can actually hang out and talk about skincare. BeReal integration for those authentic, no-filter product reviews that people actually trust. And AR try-on technology so you can see how products might work on your skin before buying. But here's the thing—all this cool tech is pointless if the basics don't work. Our predictive analytics catch people who might stop buying from them before it happens, so we can reach out and fix whatever's wrong.

**GURANSH**: Their real superpower is speed. While L'Oréal or Unilever take months to launch something new, Dot & Key can literally ride a trend and have a product out in weeks. That's their biggest advantage! We're targeting three types of customers: the "Informed Millennials" in big cities who want science and facts, the "Experimental Gen Z" crowd who want to try everything new, and the "Aspiring Beauty Enthusiasts" in smaller cities who are just getting into skincare. Each group gets completely different messaging and products, but all through the same fast system.

## **SLIDE 5: FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS**

**VEDANT**: Alright, let's talk money! Our plan spans four quarters, and honestly, it's pretty realistic. Q1 is all about stabilizing after the crisis and getting the basic funnel working properly. Q2 is when we launch the loyalty programs and really start optimizing engagement. Q3 gets into the advanced stuff—personalization, better conversion tactics. And Q4? That's when we start looking at international expansion, especially targeting Indian communities abroad. We want 15% improvement in middle-funnel metrics by Q2, 20% of customers participating in referrals by Q3, and cart abandonment down to 40% by Q4.

**VAIDIK**: The numbers are pretty exciting, actually. We're targeting ₹350 crores in revenue, but honestly? With their current growth rate of 244%, we wouldn't be surprised if they hit ₹400 crores. The big game-changer is improving email engagement from 22% to 35%. When you multiply that across 6 million customers, the revenue impact is huge. We need ₹12 crores total investment across technology, content, and marketing, but we're projecting 4.2 times return on investment within 18 months. The math works because referrals and automation make everything more efficient.

**HRIDHAY**: What gets me excited about the financial model is how technology multiplies everything. The WhatsApp automation isn't pushing sales—it's actually giving real skincare advice, which builds trust, which converts to loyalty. Heat mapping shows us exactly where people get confused on the website. AR trials mean fewer returns. And predictive analytics help us keep customers before they even think about leaving. We're even planning voice-activated sampling like what NARS did on Spotify. Dot & Key becomes this perfect blend of beauty brand and tech company.

## **SLIDE 6: THE VISION**

**VRINDA**: So here's our big picture vision—we want Dot & Key to become THE skincare education brand for young Indian women. Not just another company selling face creams, but the place you go to learn about skincare, get advice, and feel part of a community. The whole Hania Aamir thing actually proved they can bounce back from anything, so now we're channeling that same energy into becoming the clear leader in India's ₹28 billion beauty market.

**GURANSH**: Think about it—when your customer can chat with a real person on WhatsApp about their skin problems, virtually try products using AR, learn from actual dermatologists on Amazon miniTV, and get their order delivered in 2 hours, that's not just shopping anymore. That's like having a beauty expert as your best friend! We're making it so convenient and personal that switching to another brand just doesn't make sense—emotionally or practically.

**VEDANT**: Bottom line—this isn't just about hitting revenue targets or fixing conversion rates. We're building something bigger. Dot & Key becomes the brand that really gets modern Indian women: they're tech-savvy but want personal service, globally aware but proud to be Indian, they research everything but want instant results. Speed plus science plus real community—that's a combination competitors can't just copy overnight. And that's how you build something that lasts.

**ALL**: So... any questions about our strategy?
