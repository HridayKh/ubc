## **7. Growth and Retention**

## **What’s Working**

- Personalized quizzes and upsell on site—but upsell/downsells can be better optimized for new launches
- Good A/B testing of product page layouts and discount pop-ups
- *AVOL (Average Value of Order Lift)* focus in cart, but 58% abandonment means room for more optimization

- **Trustpilot Ratings:** Dedicated digital care team for timely responses; incentivize reviews with micro-rewards on site/QR post-purchase

## **8. Funnel (Optional) & Advanced Tools**

**Awareness:**

- Meme/trend-driven content, collabs, influencer reels (broad/viral reach)

**Consideration:**

- Skin quiz, influencer testimonials, in-depth education reels

**Conversion:**

2. **Profit on First Purchase**
    1. Bundled value kits and flash “first-trial” drops with mini sizes.

4. **Upsell & Downsell**

The combination of nation-first positioning, scientific credibility, and customer-centric technology creates a defendable competitive advantage in India's rapidly growing ₹28 billion beauty market.

**SHORT SCRIPT**\

**[Slide 1: Brand Identity & Performance]**

Dot & Key’s mission is simple yet ambitious: to democratize high-efficacy, science-powered skincare—infusing a serious category with a playful, relatable tone. We’re innovative, approachable, and have built a 6+ million customer base, growing our revenue 244% last year to almost ₹200 crore. Instagram engagement stands at an exceptional 5.6%, though credibility on Trustpilot—at just 2.2—signals work to be done.

**[Slide 2: Differentiation]**

What sets us apart? Speed. Dot & Key is nimble with new launches, science-led, and designed for Indian skin. Where others take months, we ride trends with a bold influencer playbook—blending credible education with fun. But, we have ground to cover in boosting review trust and scaling global/NRI presence.

**[Slide 3: Audience Persona]**

Our focus: Indian Gen Z and Millennials—urban, 75% female—beauty-obsessed, always online, and proud to share discoveries. They care about real results, ingredient safety, and peer validation, making Reels, reviews, and influencers crucial in decision journeys.

**[Slide 4: SWOT & Gaps]**

We win with viral content, influencer collaborations, and quick commerce partnerships, but high cart abandonment and patchy review engagement remain challenges. To differentiate, we’re spotlighting new platforms—Discord, Reddit, BeReal—and optimizing for NRI markets.

**[Slide 5: Trust Recovery—Hania Aamir Crisis]**

In April, a celebrity partnership backfired, triggering #BoycottDotAndKey. Our trust recovery is action-led: launching a “Made in India, Made for India” campaign, donating per order to Armed Forces welfare, and refocusing on Indian festivals with local ambassadors.

**[Slide 6: Content & Community]**

Currently, 70% of our posts are short-form video or Reels, with campaigns like #BreakUpWithAcne—213 influencers, nearly a million views, and huge engagement. Next, we’ll launch a BTS Instagram to humanize the brand, use grid reorder for episodic storytelling, and accelerate NRI-focused launches with Instagram Shops.

**[Slide 7: Meta Ad & Conversion Funnel]**

Our best-performing ads: relatable routines, UGC for authenticity, and festive FOMO offers, all delivered to tightly-targeted audiences. We’re cutting spend wastage with smart audience exclusion, and backing top-funnel discovery with engaging influencer content.

**[Slide 8: AVOL & Cart Recovery]**

But, we leave money on the table: 58% carts abandoned, AOV at ₹850, and acquisition cost a bit high. Solutions: personalize checkout with upsells like “Complete your Routine,” trigger WhatsApp/email reminders, and reward first-buy profit with starter kits and subscription discounts.

**[Slide 9: Loyalty, Referral, Retention]**

With a points-driven loyalty program and refer-a-friend “Give ₹300, Get ₹300,” we lower acquisition costs, increase LTV, and re-engage churned users through WhatsApp flows and Discord micro-communities.

**[Slide 10: Tools, Growth Hacks, & KPIs]**

Layer on BIK for WhatsApp automation, REELO for repeat orders, and heatmaps to optimize every user touch. We’ll experiment on Discord, Reddit (+42% beauty discussion growth), BeReal, and Spotify to future-proof brand reach.

Goals? Raise engagement above 6%, cut cart abandons to under 40%, boost first-purchase profit, and climb at least 1 point on Trustpilot.

**[Slide 11: Expert Recommendations]**

Finally, deploy profit-driven upsell flows, use audience exclusions in Meta ads, add a dedicated BTS channel, prioritize founder-led review responses, and invest in analytics and automation.

**[Slide 12: Close]**

Dot & Key’s next chapter marries nation-first trust, digital innovation, and customer-centric technology—creating a credible, unstoppable force in one of India’s most exciting consumer markets. Thank you.
