Dot & Key‚Äôs Creator Campaign Performance

Behind these reels and shorts was a deeply analytical campaign. Dot & Key mapped every influencer post to a specific product line, allowing them to track not just engagement but also how individual SKUs performed.

In total, over 4,100 influencer posts were tracked across Instagram and YouTube in 2025 alone. These covered 12 key product categories, from sunscreen to serums to lip balms. By aggregating data across creators and content types, some fascinating patterns emerged.

For instance, the Vitamin C Serum was the most widely featured product, with 449 influencer posts generating a total engagement of 34,472. The Cica DC Cream followed closely with 436 posts and 30,880 total engagement. Other high performers included the Brightening Cream, Watermelon Sunscreen, and Blueberry Barrier Boost Serum, each generating upwards of 30,000 in total engagement.

But raw numbers were only part of the story. Dot & Key paid close attention to average engagement per post, which painted a more accurate picture of how content resonated. The Brightening Cream, for example, delivered an average engagement of 123.8 per post on Instagram, while the Vitamin C Moisturizer excelled on YouTube with 97.7 average engagement per post. These insights shaped their future influencer selection and platform strategy, helping the team double down where content truly clicked.

By making data central to their creator campaigns, Dot & Key turned influencer marketing from a one-off tactic into a repeatable, scalable performance channel.
From Skin Stories to Skincare Success

What made Dot & Key‚Äôs influencer strategy so impactful wasn‚Äôt just the number of creators they worked with, it was the strategic intent behind every collaboration. By mapping content to product lines, blending micro and mid-tier creators, and letting influencers tell their stories authentically, the brand transformed ordinary skincare moments into powerful marketing touchpoints.

Each reel, review, or GRWM post didn‚Äôt just generate views, it built trust. And in a category as personal as skincare, trust is what converts.

Dot & Key‚Äôs journey proves that when you combine the right creators, a well-defined product story, and a sharp eye on performance, influencer marketing becomes more than a tactic it becomes a growth engine.

As the creator economy continues to evolve, this kind of thoughtful, product-led storytelling will only become more essential for brands looking to connect with digital-native audiences. And for Dot & Key, the results are already written across thousands of posts, comments, and glowing skin stories.
